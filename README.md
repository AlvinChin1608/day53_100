# day53_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Automated Data Entry for Remote Jobs

This Python script demonstrates automated data entry capabilities, specifically designed for remote job roles such as data entry tasks. It leverages web scraping and form-filling automation to streamline repetitive tasks, showcasing the practical application of automation in a professional context.

## Features:
- __Web Scraping:__ Utilizes _requests_ and _BeautifulSoup_ to extract property data from a specified URL on Zillow.
- __Data Processing:__ Cleans and formats scraped data (addresses, prices, and links) for usability in subsequent tasks.
- __Form Filling Automation:__ Uses _Selenium_ to automatically fill out Google Forms with the scraped data, demonstrating how automation can enhance efficiency in data entry processes.
- __CSV Export:__ Outputs the scraped data into a CSV file (zillow_data.csv), providing a structured format for further analysis or storage.

## Why Automation?
Automation plays a crucial role in reducing manual effort and human error, making it invaluable in remote job settings where repetitive tasks like data entry are prevalent. This script serves as an example of how automation can optimize workflow and free up time for more strategic activities.

## What I've Learned:
Through developing this project, I've enhanced my skills in:

- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup for data extraction.
- Automation techniques with Selenium for web interaction and form filling.
- Data processing and formatting to ensure data integrity and usability.
- CSV handling in Python for structured data export and analysis.

This project demonstrates technical proficiency and highlights the practical benefits of automation in professional environments, paving the way for more efficient and productive workflows.
